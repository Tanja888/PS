# For loops
# Author: Tanja Juric

# for elements in lists
    # do something

# for number in range (1,10):
    # do something

# lists with plural names
# iterating through the list: 
boats = ['Sigma', 'Bounty', 'Swan', 13]
for boat in boats: 
    print ("I'd prefer to be out on a " + str(boat)) #converts into string to be able to add 13
    print ("out on the water")  #has to be indented to be inside the for loop

# only does a range down, cannot put (10,1) 
for number in range (1,11):
    print ("hello", number)
